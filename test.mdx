## Overview test 123

The Updates page automatically detects changes in your codebase and helps you keep documentation synchronized with code changes. The page displays a list of affected documentation sections and provides tools to review and regenerate content.

---

## Accessing Updates

You can access the Updates page in two ways:

- **Dashboard sidebar**: Navigate directly from the sidebar menu
- **Updates counter button**: Click the updates counter button on the dashboard, which displays the number of pending updates and provides quick access to the Updates page

The page loads automatically and fetches all detected changes from your connected repository.

---

## Page Layout

The Updates page uses a split-pane interface:

- **Left pane**: Scrollable list of all detected updates
- **Right pane**: Detailed view of the selected update with diff visualization

---

## Understanding Update Types

Each update is tagged with one of three status badges:

- **Updated**: Existing documentation affected by code changes
- **New**: New code additions that require documentation
- **Deleted**: Code removed from the codebase

<Callout type="info">
The status badge appears in the top-right corner of each update card with color-coded styling (yellow for updated, green for new, red for deleted).
</Callout>

---

## Reviewing Updates

### Browsing Updates

Use the search bar at the top of the left pane to filter updates by title or category. Click any update card to view its details in the right pane.

### Navigation Controls

Navigate between updates using:

- **Previous/Next buttons**: Located in the header and footer of the right pane
- **Card selection**: Click any card in the left sidebar
- **Counter display**: Shows current position (e.g., "3 of 12")

### Viewing Update Details

Each update card displays:

- **Title**: Function or section name extracted from frontmatter
- **Category**: Derived from the title (text before the first dot)
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp of when the change was detected
- **Status Badge**: Visual indicator of change type

---

## Taking Action on Updates

### Regenerating Documentation

For **updated** or **deleted** items:

1. Click the **"Regenerate"** button on any update card
2. The system calls the `/updates-regenerate` endpoint with the old documentation, old code, and new code
3. A diff view appears showing line-by-line changes between the original and regenerated documentation

<Callout type="tip">
Changes are color-coded:

- **Green lines** (with `+` icon): New additions  
- **Red lines** (with `-` icon): Removed content  
- **Gray lines**: Unchanged content
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
If regeneration produces no changes, a toast notification appears:

"No changes were made. Your code changes likely have no effect on the documentation."
</Callout>

---

### Generating New Documentation

For **new** items:

1. Click the **"Generate"** button on the update card
2. The system calls the `/generate-docs` endpoint with the unique identifier (UID) of the new code
3. A diff view shows the newly generated documentation compared to an empty baseline

---

## Workflow Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load Updates">
Open the Updates page. The system automatically fetches changes detected since your last documentation sync.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
Browse the list of updates in the left pane. Each card shows what changed and when.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regenerate Documentation">
Select an update and click "Regenerate" or "Generate" to produce updated documentation based on the code changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect Diff">
Review the line-by-line diff showing exactly what changed in the documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
Click the "Save current page" button in the header to persist the regenerated documentation changes to the system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Loading States

The page handles three states:

- **Loading**: Displays a spinner with "Loading updates..." message
- **Empty**: Shows "No codebase changes detected" when no updates exist
- **Error**: Displays error message if the backend request fails

---

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

The page integrates with three backend endpoints:

- `POST /updates-changes`

Fetches all detected changes Called on page load at `src/app/(dashboard)/updates/page.tsx:196`

- `POST /updates-regenerate`

Regenerates documentation for updated/deleted items `src/app/(dashboard)/updates/page.tsx:263`

- `POST /generate-docs`

Generates documentation for new code additions `src/app/(dashboard)/updates/page.tsx:255`

---

### Data Structure

<Callout type="info">
Updates are stored with the following properties:
</Callout>

```typescript
interface UpdateCard {
  id: string              // Unique identifier
  title: string           // Extracted from frontmatter or fully_qualified_name
  category: string        // Derived from title
  lastUpdated: string     // ISO timestamp
  content: string         // Current documentation markdown
  status: "updated" | "new" | "deleted"
  filename: string        // Source file path
  oldCode: string         // Previous code version
  newCode: string         // Updated code version
}
```

---

### Diff Algorithm

<Callout type="tip">
The page uses a longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute line-by-line diffs between old and new documentation (implemented at `src/app/(dashboard)/updates/page.tsx:63-101`).
