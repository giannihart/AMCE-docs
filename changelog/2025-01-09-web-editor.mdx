The **web editor** now has a more intuitive interface and new capabilities.

- **Visual navigation editing**: Configure your navigation structure in the web editor and see how your site's navigation sidebar looks in the editor. All changes map to your `docs.json` automatically.

- **Configuration options**: Adjust all site configuration options from the editor without manually editing your `docs.json`.

- **Drag-and-drop assets**: Drag images and files directly from your computer into the file tree to upload them.

- **Improved stability**: Stability improvements and mobile responsiveness.
